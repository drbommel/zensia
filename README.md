# zensia
A community-driven privacy-focused cryptocurrency concept - Considerations on how Satoshi would design Bitcoin in 2025

## Vision
Zensia aims to be developed as a truly community-driven project, focused on privacy, fairness, and accessibility. This repository contains the initial concept and implementation.

## Research Foundations

Zensia is built upon rigorous academic research in cryptography and distributed systems. The original research preprint that inspired this project is available in the [docs/research](docs/research) directory. We encourage all community members to review this foundational document to better understand the theoretical principles that underpin Zensia's implementation.

The preprint provides valuable insights into:
- The cryptographic foundations of Zensia's privacy features
- The theoretical basis for our consensus mechanism
- The original vision for decentralized governance
- Mathematical proofs supporting the security model

While the implementation has evolved through community contributions, the core principles outlined in the original research remain central to Zensia's identity.

## Status
This is an early concept with basic implementation. The project is open for community development and has no central authority or roadmap.

## Getting Started
- Review the code in the repository
- Read the whitepaper.md for conceptual overview
- Run zensia_demo.py to see a basic demonstration

## Community Development
This project has no central planning. All development decisions will be made through community consensus. Feel free to fork, extend, and submit pull requests.
