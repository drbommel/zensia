# Technical Architecture

*Note: This document describes the current conceptual architecture. All aspects are subject to community review and improvement.*

## System Overview
Zensia's implementation consists of several core components that work together to create a privacy-focused cryptocurrency system:

1. Core blockchain structure
2. Privacy layer using zero-knowledge proofs
3. Transaction handling mechanism
4. PoS-BFT consensus implementation

## Component Interactions
The components interact through defined interfaces, allowing for modular development and testing.

## Current Implementation
The current codebase demonstrates the basic concepts with simplified implementations of:
- Block structure and chain validation
- Basic transaction privacy using zero-knowledge concepts
- Simple staking mechanism
- Network consensus simulation

## Technical Limitations
The current implementation has several limitations that community development could address:
- Simplified cryptographic primitives
- Limited transaction throughput
- Basic privacy features that could be enhanced
