## Zensia Preprint

### Disclaimer

The `Preprint.pdf` document in this directory represents the initial research and theoretical concepts that inspired the Zensia cryptocurrency project. It serves as the foundational academic work that established the core principles and technical approaches of Zensia.

**Important notes about this document:**

- This preprint reflects the original research vision and may differ from the current implementation in some aspects as the project has evolved through community input and practical development considerations.

- Some technical details, timelines, or development approaches mentioned in the preprint may have been adjusted during implementation to better serve the project's goals.

- The document is provided primarily for historical context, academic reference, and to give new community members insight into the theoretical foundations of Zensia.

- While the core principles outlined in this document remain central to Zensia, the project has transitioned to a community-driven development model where implementation decisions are made collectively.

### Purpose of This Archive

We maintain this document as part of Zensia's commitment to transparency, proper attribution of ideas, and preserving the academic rigor that underlies the project. Understanding the theoretical foundations of Zensia is valuable for contributors who wish to help evolve the project while maintaining alignment with its core vision.

### Relationship to Current Implementation

Community members should reference the main technical documentation in the `/docs` directory for the most current and accurate descriptions of Zensia's implementation. This preprint should be considered supplementary material that provides deeper insights into the reasoning behind certain design decisions.
