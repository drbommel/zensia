# Zensia Developer Guide

*Note: This document provides recommendations and suggestions for development. These are not requirements but rather guidelines to help maintain consistency across community contributions.*

## Introduction

This guide provides suggestions for developers interested in contributing to the Zensia cryptocurrency project. As a community-driven project, Zensia welcomes diverse approaches and implementations that align with the core principles of privacy, security, and decentralization.

## Development Environment

### Suggested Setup

The following setup has been found useful for Zensia development:

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.9+ for core implementation, with Rust for performance-critical components
- **Development Environment**: Any preferred editor or IDE with Python support
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Testing**: pytest for unit tests, hypothesis for property-based testing

Alternative setups are equally welcome as long as they support the project's goals.

## Repository Structure

The recommended repository structure is as follows:

zensia/ ├── core/ # Core blockchain components │ ├── blockchain.py # Blockchain state management │ ├── consensus.py # Consensus implementation │ └── privacy.py # Privacy features ├── networking/ # P2P networking components ├── wallet/ # Wallet implementation ├── tests/ # Test suite └── docs/ # Documentation

Community developers may suggest and implement alternative structures if they better serve the project's needs.

## Code Style Suggestions

### Python

Consider following these style guidelines for Python code:

- Follow PEP 8 for code formatting
- Use type hints to improve code readability
- Document functions and classes with docstrings
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Aim for clear variable and function names

### Rust

For Rust components, consider:

- Following the standard Rust style guide
- Using the Rust 2021 edition features where appropriate
- Leveraging the type system for safety guarantees

## Testing Recommendations

Testing is valuable for ensuring code quality. Consider the following approaches:

- Write unit tests for individual components
- Create integration tests for component interactions
- Implement property-based tests for complex behaviors
- Use mock objects to isolate components during testing

## Documentation

Good documentation helps the community understand and contribute to the project. Consider documenting:

- Function and class purposes and behaviors
- Architecture decisions and rationales
- API specifications and examples
- Setup and running instructions

## Pull Request Process

When submitting contributions, consider following this process:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Implement your changes
4. Add tests for your changes
5. Update documentation as needed
6. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes

## Community Interaction

The Zensia project benefits from positive community interaction. Consider these practices:

- Discuss significant changes before implementing them
- Be open to feedback and suggestions
- Help review other contributors' code
- Share knowledge and help other contributors

## Security Considerations

When working on security-sensitive components, consider:

- Following established cryptographic best practices
- Not implementing custom cryptographic primitives
- Using well-vetted libraries for cryptographic operations
- Conducting thorough testing of security-critical code

## Performance Optimization

Performance is important but should generally be balanced with code clarity. Consider:

- Writing clear code first, then optimizing if necessary
- Profiling to identify actual bottlenecks
- Documenting performance-critical sections
- Using appropriate data structures and algorithms

Remember that these are suggestions to help guide development efforts, not strict requirements. The Zensia community values diverse approaches that advance the project's goals.
