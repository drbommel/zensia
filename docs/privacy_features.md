# Zensia Privacy Features

*Note: This document describes concepts that are open for community discussion and implementation.*

## Overview

Zensia's privacy architecture combines several cryptographic techniques to achieve strong privacy guarantees while maintaining the ability to validate transactions. This document outlines the core privacy features that community developers may implement and extend.

## Core Privacy Technologies

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Zensia leverages zero-knowledge proofs to validate transactions without revealing sensitive information. Potential approaches include:

- **zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge)** - Allow users to prove possession of certain information without revealing the information itself
- **Bulletproofs** - More compact zero-knowledge proofs that don't require a trusted setup

These techniques enable transaction validation while keeping transaction amounts, sender addresses, and recipient addresses confidential.

### Stealth Addresses

Stealth addresses enhance privacy by generating one-time addresses for each transaction. Community developers may consider implementing:

- One-time public keys derived from recipient's public key
- Ring signature integration to mask the actual destination
- Hierarchical deterministic wallet support for stealth addresses

### CoinJoin/Mixing

CoinJoin mechanisms combine multiple transactions into a single transaction, making it difficult to trace the flow of funds. The implementation architecture provides:

- Decentralized mixing without trusted intermediaries
- Variable anonymity set sizes to balance privacy and performance
- Resistance against common deanonymization attacks

## Additional Privacy Enhancements

Community developers may consider several additional privacy enhancements:

### Network-Level Privacy

- Integration with Tor or I2P networks to mask IP addresses
- Dandelion++ protocol for transaction propagation to prevent network-level deanonymization

### Confidential Transactions

- Hidden transaction amounts using Pedersen commitments
- Range proofs to verify transaction validity without revealing amounts

## Privacy-Performance Tradeoffs

Implementing strong privacy features comes with computational costs. The community can explore different approaches to balance privacy and performance:

- Optional privacy features with different strength levels
- Layer 2 solutions for privacy-enhanced transactions
- Privacy pools with different anonymity set sizes

## Implementation Status

The current implementation demonstrates the core privacy concepts through:

- Basic stealth address generation
- Simplified zero-knowledge proof verification
- Transaction obfuscation

Community members interested in advancing Zensia's privacy features are encouraged to explore these areas and contribute improvements.
